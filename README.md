Hello! This is my first ever website (April 29th 2020) that I intend to use as my portfolio site. I hope this code will help you build your own site or whatever else you're here for. This site is built to run on most browsers and only consits of HTML, CSS and some basic Javascrip so it should'nt be to complicated to figure out! 
Good luck!
